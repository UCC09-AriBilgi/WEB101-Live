    <div>
        <p>
            C# is the most common programming language used to develop multiple applications in the.NET framework, and it was introduced by Microsoft in 2000. It was designed to be a simple, object-oriented programming language that can be used to create a wide range of applications and software. It features a clear syntax, an object-oriented nature, and platform independence, which makes it simpler for developers to organise their code and makes it more legible and manageable.
            It is platform-independent in the sense that it may be used to create programmes that operate on different platforms such as Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices. This makes C# a versatile language.
